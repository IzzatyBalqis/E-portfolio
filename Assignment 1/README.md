## ðŸ“ƒReflection ##

The NALI presentation at University Technologies Malaysia (UTM), showcasing a variety of educational projects, proved to be captivating. Each exhibit offered fresh insights and opportunities for honing analytical and problem-solving skills. The program provided a glimpse into the future of education while underscoring the importance of fostering inclusive and innovative learning environments. Observing the NALI operation prompted me to contemplate how technology could potentially revolutionize the educational landscape.

## ðŸ’ªImprovement ##
From my point of view, there is a certain aspect lacking in NALI, which is that the organizers should establish a feedback mechanism to gather insights from attendees. This would allow participants to share their thoughts and suggestions for improving exhibits and the overall organization of the event. In addition, specific exhibits could benefit from interactive learning opportunities. A better way to attract participants would be to provide chances for hands-on activities or demonstrations. However, I want to emphasize that these are just my suggestions. In general, I found that this event provided the most positive experience for me.

## ðŸ‘€Others ##
I'm inspired by the NALI operation's use of technology to improve education. Observing how effortlessly modern technologies are adopted got me thinking about how technology may fundamentally change how people learn and develop as professionals. Not only that, this events give me more knowledge and insights of the latest technologies
