## ğŸ“ƒReflection ##
The Assemble PC Lab's objective is to provide students hands-on experience understanding the internal hardware components of a computer. Participants gain knowledge over the complex process of assembling these hardware components through step-by-step teaching, making it possible for them to successfully boot up a computer. With a focus on practical knowledge, the lab helps students become adept in the assembly of PC components. A final test evaluates the participants' newly acquired knowledge and skills to wrap up the training.
