## ðŸ“ƒReflection ##
The Assemble PC Lab's objective is to provide students hands-on experience understanding the internal hardware components of a computer. Participants gain knowledge over the complex process of assembling these hardware components through step-by-step teaching, making it possible for them to successfully boot up a computer. With a focus on practical knowledge, the lab helps students become adept in the assembly of PC components. A final test evaluates the participants' newly acquired knowledge and skills to wrap up the training.

## ðŸ’ªImprovement ##
The Assemble PC Lab need refinement, especially in the way components are introduced to students. Using visual aids to improve comprehension, such pictures and videos, would be advantageous, especially for people who learn best visually. Developing a platform that allows students to communicate with professionals and get advice might potentially improve education in general.

## ðŸ‘€Others ##
By taking part in the Assemble PC Lab, I was able to learn the fundamentals of PC assembly and get insightful knowledge of computer components. Even if I'm not an expert yet, the experience has given me the knowledge and skills necessary to comprehend and value the procedure. I can now explore and understand more about PC building with more comfort. The lab has helped me become more comfortable navigating the world of computer hardware.
