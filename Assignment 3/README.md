## ðŸ“ƒReflection  ##
The UTMDIGITAL visit proved to be not only fascinating but also highly educational, leaving a lasting impression. Interacting with company executives and immersing myself in cutting-edge technology provided valuable insights. Conversations with professionals expanded my perspective, revealing previously hidden implications of technology in the real world. Beyond being a strong motivator, this experience deepened my understanding of the rapidly evolving technological landscape and strengthened my commitment to academic excellence.

## ðŸ’ªImprovement ##
In my view, the planners have to offer resources or information prior to the trip. It would be helpful if participants understood the basics of the technology they would be relying on. Furthermore, adding gamification elements to the tour, such as puzzles or tests regarding the technology on exhibition, will make the tourists happier. Should these recommendations be implemented, the trip would be memorable and enlightening.
